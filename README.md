This is a simple web application built with React that allows users to convert between 2 different currencies

2. Amount input- A numerical input field for user to enter amount 
3. Real time coversion through API INTEGRATION
4. Error Handling - Basic error messages are shown if there are issues fetching data or if the user tries to convert without entering an amount.
5. Visual Enhancements

I have used : React Js & Css

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```
    (Replace `[your-repository-url]` with the actual URL of your project repository and `[your-repository-name]` with the name of the cloned directory.)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up API Keys/URLs (if required):**
    * If your currency exchange rate API or flag API requires API keys, you might need to configure them in your application. Look for instructions within the code or any `.env` files.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

5.  **Open in your browser:**
    * The application should automatically open in your default web browser. If not, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your terminal).
